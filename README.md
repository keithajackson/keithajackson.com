# keithajackson.com, via Webpack! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

I love working with Webpack and large-scale single-page applications, so I am
using my workflow to develop and maintain my portfolio site.

Things we get with Webpack:
 - Hot-reloading with builds
 - Lazy-loading for different pages

## Things in progress

1. Migrate old content to pages on new site
2. Add eslint for sanity testing
3. Integrate CI and CD with Travis to auto-publish when master gets updated
